# VIEW-CAPTURED-TRAFFIC-IN-WIRESHARK-ARP-
This project demonstrates how to capture, inspect, and analyze ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) traffic using Wireshark, as well as how to view local ARP cache entries on a PC. The lab walks through capturing ARP requests/replies, analyzing data at multiple protocol layers, and understanding how ARP functions within a TCP/IP network.
